# Left hand Chording - Inspired by [pocketkk](https://www.reddit.com/user/pocketkk) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/4ei1w8/planck_8_layers_left_hand_chording_right_hand/) r/olkb thread

This keyboard map is heavy on layers using your left hand to pick a layer, and
your right to enter text.  It's been likened to using chords.  For me - it's
more like the idea of when you need keys other than the alphas, it's more a matter of mainly using your right hand like you're operating a 10-key,
and your left is helping out.
